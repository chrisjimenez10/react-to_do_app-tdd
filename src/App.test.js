//NOTE: We can use the "jest.mock()" method to ASSING a "data-testid" attribute to a Component and capture it via that Test Id --> This is the syntax
  // Using the "jest.mock()" method: It is a powerful tool for creating mock functions and modules. This is essential for isolating the component or function being tested from its dependencies, ensuring that tests are reliable, maintainable, and efficient --> 1.Isolation: To test a component or function without invoking its dependencies, 2.Control: To control the behavior of dependencies and simulate different scenarios, 3.Performance: To speed up tests by avoiding expensive operations like network requests
// jest.mock("./Form", ()=> ()=> <div data-testid="form-component"/>)
